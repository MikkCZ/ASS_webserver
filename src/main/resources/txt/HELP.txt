Welcome to stankmic webserver. Here is a very short help, how to run it.

The webserver can be launched from command line using these switches:
    -p|-port    [PORT NUMBER]
        The PORT NUMBER has to be free port number. If not specified, default (80) will be used.
    -d|-dir     [BASE DIRECTORY]
        The BASE DIRECTORY is a directory, where the requested content cannot be placed out of the scope of the BASE DIRECTORY - will be serverd by 403 HTTP code. If not specified, current working directory will be used.

If you want to protect some directory (and its subdirectories) with Basic access authentication, just place there text file named ".access_stankmic". In so named file authenticated users can be listed like this:
    user01:password01
    user02:password02

To stop the server, press Ctrl+C.
